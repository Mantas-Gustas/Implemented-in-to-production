Implemented in to production work projects


I used PyAutoGui library functions to automate some of the manual tasks I had to carry out in my current role.

This implementation of the python code with relevent libraries has reduce the time I had to consume in completing the task manually by more then 50%.

The code extracts data from excel, then assigns the data to variables, added PyAutoGui functionalities to functions which are held inside the mobile_functionsModule.py module, inside the same module I'm also holding varialbles.

Then mobile_functionsModule.py is imported in to the main O2 and CH named scripts and with other functionalities impletemented the script is executed and automated work is carried out for me.

I only attached couple of samples from total of 8x, the other scrips are slightly different but the principles are the same.
