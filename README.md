Implemented in to production work projects


I used PyAutoGui library functions to automate some of the manual tasks I had to carry out in current role.

This implementation of the python code has reduce the time I had to consume by more then 50%.

The code extracts date from excel, then assigns the data to variables, add PyAutoGui functionality to functions which are held inside the mobile_functionsModule.py module, inside the same module I'm also holding varialble.

Then mobile_functionsModule.py is imported in main O2 and CH names scripts and with other functionality impletement the scripts are runned and automated work is carried out for me.
